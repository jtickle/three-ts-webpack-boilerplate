THREE.js + Typescript + Webpack Boilerplate
===========================================

Because instead of spending most of a Sunday playing with THREE.js, I
spent most of a Sunday making a sane dev environment.

This starts you off with a webpack-dev-server that builds a page with a
full-height, full-width, auto-resizing canvas. You should just be able
to run `npm run start` and away you go.

Hope it helps. Feedback and contributions welcome. It's
[unlicensed](https://unlicense.org/) so hopefully you can juse use it if
you need it. It's a nice place to start from.

This was useful as of March 19, 2023. If you come from the future and
it's still useful, please drop me a line and I'll update this.
